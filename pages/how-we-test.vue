                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    If you've come here, you're probably wondering about our testing process. It's totally
                    understandable, given the fact that the internet is flooded with different tool reviews and it's
                    hard to find a
                    reliable source.

                    We also feel that way and that is why we decided to create this page. We want to help you see the
                    pros and cons of different programming tools and help you make a good decision.

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    We believe in full transparency. If a feature is not available or doesn't work as expected, we
                    communicate this clearly in our reviews. Our goal is to provide accurate and up-to-date information
                    to help you make informed decisions.

                    The world of developer tools is constantly evolving. That's why we regularly revisit and update our
                    reviews to ensure they reflect the latest versions and features of each tool.
